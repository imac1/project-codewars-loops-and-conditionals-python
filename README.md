# Project Codewars - Loops and conditionals

## Story

In this project, the goal is to challenge your knowledge in loops and conditionals and advance on Codewars.

> In this project, we ask you to solve these exercises on Codewars, but insert your solution here.
>
> By inserting your solution, you can easily check your peers' solution on reviews, by running *tests*.
>
> Speaking about tests! You can find a *class* named like *Test<kata-name>* and some other seemingly odd and new code snippets.
> These are ONLY there to help you check your solution, you don't need to worry about them!

## What are you going to learn?

- loops and conditionals
- solve algorithmic challenges

## Tasks

1. Train on the challenge [Even or Odd](https://codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `even-or-odd.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

2. Train on the challenge [Find the smallest integer](https://codewars.com/kata/55a2d7ebe362935a210000b2)
    - Insert your solution in the `smallest-integer.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

3. Train on the challenge [Remove First and Last Character](https://codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0)
    - Insert your solution in the `remove-char.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

4. Train on the challenge [String repeat](https://codewars.com/kata/57a0e5c372292dd76d000d7e)
    - Insert your solution in the `string-repeat.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

5. Train on the challenge [A wolf in sheep's clothing](https://codewars.com/kata/5c8bfa44b9d1192e1ebd3d15)
    - Insert your solution in the `wolf-in-sheeps-clothing.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can test your solution of the `Even or Odd` kata after inserting your solution in `even-or-odd.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest even-or-odd.TestEvenOrOdd.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Find the smallest integer` kata after inserting your solution in `smallest-integer.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest smallest-integer.TestSmallestInt.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Remove First and Last Character` kata after inserting your solution in `remove-char.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest remove-char.TestRemoveChar.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `String Repeat` kata after inserting your solution in `string-repeat.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest string-repeat.TestStringRepeat.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `A wolf in sheep's clothing` kata after inserting your solution in `wolf-in-sheeps-clothing.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest wolf-in-sheeps-clothing.TestWarnTheSheep.test_basics`
